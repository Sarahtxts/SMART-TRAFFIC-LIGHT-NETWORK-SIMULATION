A simple Java-based project simulating a **smart traffic light network** using **client-server communication** and a **graphical interface**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Traffic Light Controller** â€“ Cycles through **Red â†’ Green â†’ Yellow** automatically.
- **Server-Client Communication** â€“ Vehicle clients request the current traffic light state.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** â€“ Visual representation of the traffic light using Swing.
- **Beginner-Friendly** â€“ Designed as a mini-project for learning **Computer Networks** and **Concurrency**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `LightState.java` â†’ Enum representing traffic light states (RED, YELLOW, GREEN)
- `TrafficController.java` â†’ Controls traffic light state transitions
- `TrafficLightGUI.java` â†’ Swing-based GUI to display the traffic light
- `TrafficLightServer.java` â†’ Main server handling client requests
- `VehicleClient.java` â†’ Simulates vehicles requesting traffic light state
- `VehicleHandler.java` â†’ Handles communication for each connected vehicle

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works
1. **TrafficLightServer** starts and runs the traffic controller thread.
2. **TrafficLightGUI** displays the current light, updating automatically.
3. **VehicleClient** connects to the server and receives the current light state.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or newer
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarahtxts/SMART-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-NETWORK-SIMULATION.git
   cd SMART-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-NETWORK-SIMULATION
2. Compile the source code
javac *.java
Start the server

bash
Copy
Edit
java TrafficLightServer
Run the GUI (optional)

bash
Copy
Edit
java TrafficLightGUI
Simulate a vehicle client

bash
Copy
Edit
java VehicleClient
ðŸ“· Example Output
Server Console:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Traffic Light changed to: RED
Traffic Light changed to: GREEN
Vehicle Request: Vehicle arrived
Client Console:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Traffic Light State: GREEN
ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Configuration support for cycle timings & server port

Enhanced GUI for multiple intersections

Priority handling for emergency vehicles

Use of thread pool for handling many vehicles efficiently
